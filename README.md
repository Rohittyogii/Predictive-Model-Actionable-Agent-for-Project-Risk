# 🧠 HR Attrition Risk Predictor + LLM Agent

This project is a smart HR analytics tool that uses Machine Learning and a Language Model Agent (LLM) to **predict employee attrition risk** and provide **actionable HR recommendations**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Attrition Prediction**: Predict whether an employee is at risk of leaving using ML classification models.
- 📈 **SHAP Explainability**: Shows top features influencing each prediction using SHAP values.
- 💡 **LLM Agent**: Suggests HR actions for at-risk employees based on key contributing factors.
- 📩 **HR Email Notifications**: Instantly notify HR via email for any high-risk cases.
- 📊 **Department-wise Visualization**: See attrition risk by department.
- 📁 **CSV Upload & Download**: Upload employee data and download at-risk reports.
